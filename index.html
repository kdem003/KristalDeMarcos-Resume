        <p class="lead mb-4">As someone who excels in creative thinking and learning quickly, I strive to be an asset to any team I join. With my time management skills, I am able to maintain my team on track and turn in work in a timely manner. I primarily work at companies that match my passions of being involved with an  inclusive community that strives to make the world a better place by helping those in need. During my previous job, one of my duties was to provide adequate customer service to the companyâ€™s donors and maintain active communication with them. I took pride in maintaining a high image of the foundation by constantly maintaining good relationships with other organizations we frequently partner with. Though customer service was a skill necessary for my previous job another skill I was able to develop was professional writing. In order to maintain active communication with our partners and donors. I consistently wrote and replied to emails in a timely manner, because of this I strengthened the foundation's connections and had it be recognized by other schools that later on partnered with the company in the year 2021. Throughout my career I was continuously nominated for employee of the year. As many of my hard achievements made the company be recognized nationwide. My professional skills and ethics have gotten me a promotion to become the Co-Executive Director of one of the most recognized non-profit companies in California. As my passion is primarily for Law I declined the offer and opened my own law firm. My law firm is currently one of the top 5 in the state of California. However, my teammates and I strive to be the best in the nation. Currently my team and I are serving low-income communities in hopes of being the voice they need in court. I have honed multiple skills that give me the tools I need to be successful in the courtroom. I primarily help the Spanish speaking community as they are often underrepresented. Through my past experience in retail and working for multiple non-profit organizations, I have strengthened my professional skills in speaking and writing. My past experiences in non-profits have led me to creating various programs that serve the low-income communities here in California. The Programs that I have created serve primarily in the following areas: South Central, Compton,Inglewood, Downtown LA, Baldwin Park, Downey,East Los Angeles, and the San Fernando Valley. We also provide services for people outside of these communities who are struggling. These multiple programs that I have developed and launched have helped me be able to find resources in various areas and bring awareness to the need of these programs. My passions are what constantly stand out and my determination to make a difference in my community. As a Lawyer I am currently working on various cases. I am fighting against the injustice of this faulty criminal justice system and the discrimination multiple Hispanic and Latinos are experinceing. I have worked on multiple widely known cases that have helped bring awareness of how faulty our justice is towards people of color.<br><br>
